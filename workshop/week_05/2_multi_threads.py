"""
In a process, threading allows multiple tasks to execute concurrently, i.e. appear to run simultaneously

Threading uses a technique called pre-emptive multitasking where the operating system knows about each thread
and can temporarily interrupt (i.e. pause) and resume the execution of any threads "at any time".
