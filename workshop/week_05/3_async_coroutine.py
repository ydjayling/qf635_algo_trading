"""
Asynchronous programming allows us to define non-blocking methods to run more codes concurrently.
A non-blocking method contains section of codes (usually I/O such as file access or API calls)
where it provides opportunity for other codes to run whilst awaiting for a response/result.

asyncio is the Python module to facilitate asynchronous programming.

Compared to threading which uses pre-emptive multitasking, asyncio uses cooperative multitasking.
The tasks must cooperate by announcing when  they are ready to be switched out, hence more syntax like async/await
are needed to make this happen.

In this exercise, we look at the syntax of a coroutine vs a normal method, and how to invoke it using asyncio method.
