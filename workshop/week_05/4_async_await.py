"""
In Python asyncio, we can await on coroutines and tasks (also futures).

Awaiting on coroutines to run the methods sequentially (i.e. just like normal method call, each method will complete
execution before returning, this is also known as blocking call).

In next exercise, we will learn how to run multiple coroutines in parallel by awaiting on tasks.
